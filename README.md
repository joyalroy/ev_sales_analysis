### Data Sources

Sales Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the file, containing detailed information about each sale made by the company

## Dataset :-

### Tools

- Microsoft Excel Workbok :- Data Cleaning, Data Analysis.
- Microsoft Power Bi :- Data Visualization.

### Data Cleaning

In the initial data preparation phase, the following tasks were performed.

1. Data loading & inspection.
2. Handling missing values.
3. Data cleaning & formatting.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as;

- Determine the average electric range of the electric vehicles in the dataset to gauge the technological advancements and efficiency of the EVs.
- Identify and analyze the total number of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) in the dataset.
- Calculate the percentage of BEVs relative to the total number of electric vehicles, providing insights into the dominance of fully electric models.
- Identify and analyze the total number of Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) in the dataset.
- Calculate the percentage of PHEVs relative to the total number of electric vehicles, offering insights into the market share of plug-in hybrid models.
